My comments are absed on the Gestalt Principles that directly deals with the perception and interpritation of the human beings. My suggestions and interpritations are as fallows: 

It might be better to use larger fonts for reading the plot easily. It can be understood but it imight be better if you use labe for x axis. Background colour might be more soft and live to take attention. Legend might be use but i think it is not necessary for one variable. In addition to that dash lines might be used for the x and y axis for better understanding the values on the line. At the end it is a basic but good plot.
