In y axis starting points do not understand well enough. We do not understand the y values as x is in the starting year. Some line colors
are not selected suitable to take attention because background colors are nearly same. My suggestion is that using bar plot might be used because it explins the 
differences of the different vehicle types. X and y labels might be bold and seperated from the labels' value.
