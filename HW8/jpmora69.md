The idea of plotting the two x axis is a good approach (top and bottom). Two variables based on the y axis can be easily compared. Both for the x axis and y axis units are grouped in intervals so some values (actual values) can not be understand well enough. Small intervals might be useful. There should be a plot title for informing people what the plot is for. Legend is seperated but it might be better if given together since it destract the attention. As a result plot is simple and understand easily apart from small defidiencies.
