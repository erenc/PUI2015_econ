My suggestions and interpritations are as fallows:

In y axis starting points do not understand well enough. We do not understand the y values as x is in the starting year. Some line colors are not selected suitable to take attention because background colors are nearly same. X and y labels might be bold and seperated from the labels' value.  Moreoever bar plot might be used  for instead of line graph since it explins the differences of the different vehicle types easily. Indicating the source of the plot is a good approach for giving more infiration about data source.
