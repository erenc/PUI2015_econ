excellent comments 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
=================


the 3d obstructs the structure, but the structure is symmetric so this is justified

the color is redundant with the z axis, but it helos read the y value in the 3D structure

the z axis label is ambiguous: spell the function out

the axis labels are too small to be readable




NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
==================================

jpmora
======


nice location of the legends in two different spots,

nice proportions, appropriate to display the data without getting distracted by empty space

labels too small

not robust to color blindness


lanimcl
=======

the points are green but the legend is blue.

it is not clear what the legend means: it probbaly means the size corresponds to the duration, but this is just an educated guess as the nothing in the legend refers to size

the color is unexplained and appears to be redundant with the size

tick labels are way too small

large values on teh y axis should be substituted by a compact motation (eg using units of 1000 trips)

DQOfficial 
========== 
the plot is largely empty: rmove empty space at botto and plot  the grid should extend for the full extent of the plot  
all in all it is a good simple plot  colors are confused by color-blind viewers
