My contribution to this work mainly on the calculating the
distance of trip between the stations and reverse geocoding part(Google API) and the main code parts. I also contribute to the hypothesis testing parts. 

The method is using "geopy" library using the vincenty function. The reason of using the Vincenty calculation that 
gives us a more accurate result than the other option great results.

Google API also helps us to get the adress of the station location with the coordinates.(at the and we did not use in the hypothesis)

They are only working once that explains in the .py and .ipynb documents.
